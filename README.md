# DeadSimpleForm 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.


# üìù DeadSimpleForm API Documentation

DeadSimpleForm is a lightweight, developer-first API backend for handling form submissions. Build your own frontend, send form data via HTTP, and manage it through a secure Supabase-backed backend.

---

## üîê Authentication

All routes (except `/submit`) require the user to be authenticated using Supabase Auth.

Ensure the user is logged in and session is active via middleware or client helpers.

## üìå Base URL

```txt
http://localhost:3000/api
```

# üîê Encrypted Form Submissions ‚Äî Documentation

DeadSimpleForm ensures that all form submissions are encrypted before being stored in the database. Only authenticated users with access to the form can view decrypted data.

---

## üí° Overview

* Submitted data is **encrypted on the server** using symmetric AES encryption.
* Data is **decrypted on the server** when accessed via a secure, authenticated API.
* The frontend **never stores** the encryption key ‚Äî it only receives already decrypted data.
* Supports multiple content types: `application/json` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
* Optional: Data can also be **forwarded to a webhook** in plaintext.

---

## üì• Submission Endpoint

### `POST /api/forms/submit/[slug]`

Used by **public users** to submit form data.

#### Request

* **Path Parameter**: `slug` ‚Äì Unique form identifier (e.g. `contact-form`)
* **Body (one of)**:

  * `application/json`

    ```json
    {
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com"
    }
    ```
  * `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

    ```
    name=Alice&email=alice@example.com
    ```

#### Behavior

* Looks up the form by `slug`.
* Encrypts the request body using `FORM_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` from env.
* Stores encrypted data along with IP address and user-agent in the `submissions` table.
* If the form has a `webhook_url`, forwards the **unencrypted** submission to that URL via `POST`.

#### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

---

## üîì Fetching Submissions

### `GET /api/forms/[form_id]/submissions`

Used by **authenticated form owners** to view decrypted submissions.

#### Request

* **Path Parameter**: `form_id` ‚Äì UUID of the form

#### Behavior

* Authenticates the user via Supabase Auth.
* Verifies the form belongs to the user.
* Fetches encrypted submissions from the database.
* Decrypts each record using the server-side encryption key.
* Returns fully decrypted data in JSON format.

#### Success Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "form_id": "uuid",
    "submitted_at": "2024-06-27T12:00:00Z",
    "data": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com"
    },
    "ip_address": "203.0.113.1",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 ..."
  },
  ...
]
```

---

## üîê Encryption Details

* Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
* Key: Loaded from `process.env.FORM_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`
* IV: Randomly generated per message
* Tag: GCM tag appended to ciphertext
* Output format: Base64-encoded JSON `{ iv, tag, data }`

**Example stored `data` field**:

```json
{
  "iv": "A1B2C3D4E5F6...",
  "tag": "1A2B3C4D...",
  "data": "U2FsdGVkX1+..."
}
```

---

## üì¶ Client-Side Usage

* Client (dashboard) uses:

  ```ts
  fetch(`/api/forms/${formId}/submissions`)
  ```
* No decryption logic on client. All data received is already decrypted.

---

## üìÑ Environment Variable

Make sure the following is set in `.env` or hosting environment:

```env
FORM_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=your-32-byte-long-secret-key
```

Length must be exactly **32 bytes** for AES-256.

---

## üö® Security Notes

* The encryption key is **never exposed to users**.
* Only form owners can access decrypted data.
* If the key is changed, previously encrypted data **cannot be decrypted**.
* Avoid logging raw encrypted data or keys.
